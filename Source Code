/* Program name: rock/paper/scissor and dice roll game
Version : October 16 2015
Programmer name: Tan Do
Purpose: To demonstrate my understanding of creation, compilation, and program submission
*/
// Algorithm:
// 1. User will pick a choice of game based on the menu
// 2. If the user picked the rock, paper, and scissor game than another menu displays
// 3. The user will pick rock paper or scissor
// 4. The user will lose or win based on what the program picks for itself
// 5. If the user picked the dice game than another menu displays
// 6. For the dice game, it will be random and the user will win points based on the rules
// 7. The program will exit if the user picks the "exit the program" option
/* Pseudo code:
    1. Program starts
    2. Displays menu of choice for the user
    3. If choice is 1 than the rock/paper/scissor menu will show
        -else if choice is 3, program will go back to menu
    4. If user picks Rock, than program will randomly pick one out of the 3 choices
    5. If user picks Paper, than program will randomly pick one out of the 3 choices
    6. If user picks Scissor, than program will randomly pick one out of the 3 choices
        else if choice is 4, program will go back to menu
    7. User will win or lose based on the program's choice
    8. If choice is 2 than the dice game menu will show
        -else if choice is 3, program will go back to menu
    9.  The dice game will show rules than start
    10. User will get points based on the rules
    11. Program loops for player to roll again
    12. else program will go back to menu
    13. Program stops
